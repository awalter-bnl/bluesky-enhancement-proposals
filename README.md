# bluesky-enhancement-proposals

This repository stores design documents. Process:

* Decide that a given change is too complex or sweeping to be hashed out in a
  GitHub issue and should go through a Bluesky Enhancement Proposal.
* Optionally, collaborate on an initial draft in a tool that supports multi-user
  editing such as Dropbox Paper.
* Submit the draft as a pull request. Continue refining it.
* When the design has reached consensus, merge the pull request.
* Begin work on the change itself.
